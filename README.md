# HighMark_Ticketing-and-Reservation-system

## Project Introduction

This project is an appointment system based on the C programming language. It allows admins to create, delete, and edit accounts, and users to create, query, and delete appointments.

## Technology Stack and Tools

This project is developed in `C`, using `GCC` as the compiler, and `Make and/or CMake` for project construction.

## Installation and Running Guide

After downloading the source code, use the `make` command for compilation, and then run the generated executable file with command `./main.o`.

## System Design and Implementation

The system uses a linked list data structure to store appointment information and implements functionalities for creating, querying, and deleting appointments.

## Testing and Validation

The system has been thoroughly tested by writing and running test cases.

## Project Summary and Reflection

During the project development process, I have gained a deep understanding of the application of linked list data structures and pointers, and improved my capabilities in C language programming and project management.
